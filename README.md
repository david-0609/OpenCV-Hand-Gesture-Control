# OpenCV Hand Gesture Detection and Control

## Generalised Approach
### 1. The model will draw a covex hull around the hand after separating the hand from the background, using the convex hull, find fingertips and track for gestures.
### 2. Use preexisting mediapipe model to track hand (more feasible) and use in GUI/TUI application.
